# Development Guide

This document provides guidelines for contributors to the BPF Performance project.

## Coding Conventions

* **DO** use fixed length types defined in `stdint.h` instead of language keywords determined by the compiler (e.g., `int64_t, uint8_t`, not `long, unsigned char`).

* **DO** use `const` and `static` and visibility modifiers to scope exposure of variables and methods as much as possible.

* **DO** use doxygen comments, with \[in,out\] [direction annotation](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdparam) in all public API headers. This is also encouraged, but not strictly required, for internal API headers as well.

* **DON'T** use global variables where possible.

* **DON'T** use abbreviations unless they are already well-known terms known by users (e.g., "app", "info"), or are already required for use by developers (e.g., "min", "max", "args"). Examples of bad use would be `num_widgets` instead of `widget_count`, and `opt_widgets` instead of `option_widgets` or `optional_widgets`.

* **DON'T** use hard-coded magic numbers for things that have to be consistent between different files. Instead use a `#define` or an enum or const value, as appropriate.

* **DON'T** use the same C function name with two different prototypes across the project where possible.

* **DON'T** use commented-out code, or code in an `#if 0` or equivalent. Make sure all code is actually built.

## Header Files

* **DO** make sure any header file can be included directly, without requiring other headers to be included first. That is, any dependencies should be included within the header file itself.

* **DO** include local headers (with `""`) before system headers (with `<>`). This helps ensure that local headers don't have dependencies on other things being included first, and is also consistent with the use of a local header for precompiled headers.

* **DO** list headers in alphabetical order where possible. This helps ensure there are not duplicate includes, and also helps ensure that headers are usable directly.

* **DO** use `#pragma once` in all header files, rather than using ifdefs to test for duplicate inclusion.

## Style Guide

### Automated Formatting with `clang-format`

For all C/C++ files (`*.c`, `*.cpp` and `*.h`), we use `clang-format` to apply our code formatting rules. After modifying C/C++ files and before merging, be sure to run:

```sh
$ ./scripts/format-code
```

### Formatting Notes

Our coding conventions follow the [LLVM coding standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html) with the following over-rides:

* Source lines **MUST NOT** exceed 120 columns.
* Single-line if/else/loop blocks **MUST** be enclosed in braces.

Please stage the formatting changes with your commit, instead of making an extra "Format Code" commit. Your editor can likely be set up to automatically run `clang-format` across the file or region you're editing.

The [.clang-format](../.clang-format) file describes the style that is enforced by the script, which is based off the LLVM style with modifications closer to the default Visual Studio style.

### License Header

The following license header **must** be included at the top of every code file:

```c
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

It should be prefixed with the file's comment marker. If there is a compelling reason to not include this header, the file can be added to `.check-license.ignore`.

All files are checked for this header with the script:

```sh
$ ./scripts/check-license
```

### Naming Conventions

Naming conventions we use that are not automated include:

1. Use `lower_snake_case` for variable, member/field, and function names.
2. Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for macro names and constants.
3. Prefer `lower_snake_case` file names for headers and sources.
4. Prefer full words for names over contractions (i.e., `memory_context`, not `mem_ctx`).
5. Prefix names with `_` to indicate internal and private fields or methods (e.g., `_internal_field, _internal_method()`).
6. The single underscore (`_`) is reserved for local definitions (static, file-scope definitions). e.g., static result_t `_do_something(..)`.
7. Prefix `struct` definitions with `_` (this is an exception to point 6), and always create a `typedef` with the suffix `_t`. For example:

```c
typedef struct _bpf_widget
{
    uint64_t count;
} bpf_widget_t;
```

8. Prefix BPF specific names in the global namespace with `bpf_` (e.g., `bpf_result_t`).

Above all, if a file happens to differ in style from these guidelines (e.g., private members are named `m_member` rather than `_member`), the existing style in that file takes precedence.

## Testing Guidelines

### Performance Tests

The BPF Performance project focuses on benchmarking BPF programs and maps. When contributing:

* **DO** ensure your changes don't negatively impact existing benchmark performance.
* **DO** add performance tests for new BPF program types or map types.
* **DO** document expected performance characteristics in your code.
* **DO** use consistent testing methodologies across different test scenarios.

### Test Coverage

* **DO** provide tests for every bug fix and new feature.
* **DO** ensure tests cover both success and failure paths.
* **DO** use meaningful test data that reflects real-world usage patterns.

## Documentation

* **DO** update relevant documentation when adding new features or changing existing behavior.
* **DO** include clear examples in documentation.
* **DO** document performance characteristics and expected usage patterns.
* **DO** keep README files up to date with build and usage instructions.
